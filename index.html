                Hiiii helluuu...just writing what I feel with the little I know about youu.<br>
From what I know about you, you seem like someone who makes even simple things feel special. I like how you talk about your day or be it food work etc etc...it all feels so easy and real. I dont know how but it already feels a bit comfortable taking to you like we just get along without even trying too muchðŸ˜Œ
<br>

aaandd yeaaa that perfect weekend of yours sounds honestly the best...its peaceful, feels full of calm good vibes and kinda refreshing after a long week. I think we should plan something like that someday....cooking together, songs running in the background and me selecting the playlistðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­
<br>

idk if you realise it or not but the way you manage everything like work+cooking+all your creative stuff...its actually really nice...feels like you just have that calm but confident vibe..its rare honestlyâœ¨
<br>

i hope i get to find out moree about youu soon...be it your nickname ðŸ˜›, your cute lttle habbits...or the small thigns that make you laugh.
